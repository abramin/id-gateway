notes: |
  Example client used across the Credo Attack Lab scenarios. The lab mounts
  alternate profile YAML files that intentionally loosen client restrictions
  to demonstrate how misuse of redirect URIs, PKCE, scopes, or audience rules
  can be exploited when mirrored by downstream resource servers.
